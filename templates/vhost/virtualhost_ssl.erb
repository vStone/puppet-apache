#### Start of apache::vhost::ssl ####

  ## SSL Engine Switch:
  # Enable/Disable SSL for this virtual host.
  SSLEngine on

  #   SSL Protocol support:
  # List the enable protocol levels with which clients will be able to
  # connect.  Disable SSLv2 access by default:
  SSLProtocol <%= ssl_protocol %>


  ## SSL Cipher Suite:
  # List the ciphers that the client is permitted to negotiate.
  # See the mod_ssl documentation for a complete list.
  SSLCipherSuite <%= ssl_ciphersuite %>

  ## Server Certificate:
  # Point SSLCertificateFile at a PEM encoded certificate. If the certificate
  # is encrypted, then you will be prompted for a pass phrase. Note that a
  # kill -HUP will prompt again. Keep in mind that if you have both an RSA
  # and a DSA certificate you can configure both in parallel (to also allow
  # the use of DSA ciphers, etc.)
  SSLCertificateFile <%= ssl_cert %>

  ## Server Private Key:
  # If the key is not combined with the certificate, use this directive to
  # point at the key file. Keep in mind that if you've both a RSA and a DSA
  # private key you can configure both in parallel (to also allow the use of
  # DSA ciphers, etc.)
  SSLCertificateKeyFile <%= ssl_key %>

  ## Server Certificate Chain:
  # Point SSLCertificateChainFile at a file containing the concatenation of
  # PEM encoded CA certificates which form the certificate chain for the
  # server certificate. Alternatively the referenced file can be the same as
  # SSLCertificateFile when the CA certificates are directly appended to the
  # server certificate for convinience.
<% if ! empty?(ssl_chain) -%>
  SSLCertificateChainFile <%= ssl_chain %>
<% else -%>
  # Not defined
<% end -%>

  ## Certificate Authority (CA):
  # Set the CA certificate verification path where to find CA certificates
  # for client authentication or alternatively one huge file containing all
  # of them (file must be PEM encoded).
  # Note: Inside SSLCACertificatePath you need hash symlinks to point to the
  # certificate files. Use the provided Makefile to update the hash symlinks
  # after changes.
<% if ! empty?(ssl_ca_path) -%>
  SSLCACertificatePath <%= ssl_ca_path %>

<% end -%>
  #SSLCACertificatePath /etc/ssl/apache2/ssl.crt
  #SSLCACertificateFile /etc/ssl/apache2/ca-bundle.crt

  ## Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL):
  # Set the CA revocation path where to find CA CRLs for client authentication
  # or alternatively one huge file containing all of them (file must be PEM 
  #encoded).
  # Note: Inside SSLCARevocationPath you need hash symlinks to point to the
  # certificate files. Use the provided Makefile to update the hash symlinks
  # after changes.
<% if ! empty?(ssl_ca_crl_path) -%>
  SSLCARevocationPath <%= ssl_ca_crl_path %>

<% end -%>
  #SSLCARevocationPath /etc/ssl/apache2/ssl.crl
  #SSLCARevocationFile /etc/ssl/apache2/ca-bundle.crl


  ## Client Authentication (Type):
  # Client certificate verification type and depth. Types are none, optional,
  # require and optional_no_ca. Depth is a number which specifies how deeply
  # to verify the certificate issuer chain before deciding the certificate is
  # not valid.
<% if ! empty?(ssl_verify_client) -%>
  SSLVerifyClient <%= ssl_verify_client %>
<% end -%>
<% if ! empty?(ssl_verify_depth) -%>
  SSLVerifyDepth <%= ssl_verify_depth %>
<% end -%>
  #SSLVerifyClient require
  #SSLVerifyDepth  10

  ## SSL Engine Options:
  # Set various options for the SSL engine.

  ## FakeBasicAuth:
  # Translate the client X.509 into a Basic Authorisation. This means that the
  # standard Auth/DBMAuth methods can be used for access control. The user 
  # name is the `one line' version of the client's X.509 certificate. 
  # Note that no password is obtained from the user. Every entry in the user 
  # file needs this password: `xxj31ZMTZzkVA'.

  ## ExportCertData:
  # This exports two additional environment variables: SSL_CLIENT_CERT and 
  # SSL_SERVER_CERT. These contain the PEM-encoded certificates of the server
  # (always existing) and the client (only existing when client 
  # authentication is used). This can be used to import the certificates into
  # CGI scripts.

  ## StdEnvVars:
  # This exports the standard SSL/TLS related `SSL_*' environment variables. 
  # Per default this exportation is switched off for performance reasons, 
  # because the extraction step is an expensive operation and is usually 
  # useless for serving static content. So one usually enables the exportation
  # for CGI and SSI requests only.

  ## StrictRequire:
  # This denies access when "SSLRequireSSL" or "SSLRequire" applied even under
  # a "Satisfy any" situation, i.e. when it applies access is denied and no
  # other module can change it.

  ## OptRenegotiate:
  # This enables optimized SSL connection renegotiation handling when SSL 
  # directives are used in per-directory context.
  #SSLOptions +FakeBasicAuth +ExportCertData +StrictRequire
  <FilesMatch "\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$">
    SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
  </FilesMatch>

  #<Directory "/var/www/localhost/cgi-bin">
  #    SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
  #</Directory>

<% if ! empty?(ssl_options) -%>
  SSLOptions <%= ssl_options %>
<% end -%>

  ## SSL Protocol Adjustments:
  # The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
  # approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait
  # for the close notify alert from client. When you need a different
  # shutdown approach you can use one of the following variables:

  ## ssl-unclean-shutdown:
  # This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
  # SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates the
  # SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use this when
  # you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where mod_ssl
  # sends the close notify alert.

  ## ssl-accurate-shutdown:
  # This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
  # SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
  # alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
  # practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
  # this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation works
  # correctly. 
  # Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
  # keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
  # keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
  # Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
  # their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
  # "force-response-1.0" for this.
  <IfModule setenvif_module>
    BrowserMatch ".*MSIE.*" \
    nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
    downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
  </IfModule>

  ## Per-Server Logging:
  # The home of a custom SSL log file. Use this when you want a compact
  # non-error SSL logfile on a virtual host basis.
<% if ! empty?(ssl_requestlog) -%>
  CustomLog  <%= log_dir %>/<% ssl_requestlog -%> \
    <%= ssl_requestlog_pattern %>
<% end -%>

<% if ! empty?(vhost_config) -%>
  ## Custom content. This is NOT created by the Apache::Vhost but has been
  #  configured in the apache::vhost definition.
<%
    if ! vhost_config.is_a?(Array)
      vhost_config_arr = [ vhost_config ]
    else
      vhost_config_arr = vhost_config
    end
    count = 0

      count += 1
